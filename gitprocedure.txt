I want to create a "feature branch" from the develop branch.

1. checkout or change into "develop"
2. git branch                   // to see which you are on.
3. git checkout -b feature main //create feature from main
4. git checkout feature

git status
git add .
git commit -m "add files to feature branch"
git push --set-upstream origin feature

cli merge?

Github browser,  pull request to merge into main
